         <p>Japan is one of the countries that I can keep visiting over and over. 
            Every time I visited Japan, I discovered something new about this wonderful place which kept me wanting to come back for more. 
            This time, we are visiting Japan in October, which is just in time for the beautiful fall foliage. 
            And I cannot wait to share my journey with you.</p>
         <h3>Day 1</h3>
         <div id="testP" class="funParagraph"><p>We will arrive at Haneda Airport at 3pm. 
            From here, we will take the Keikyu Airport Line and Yamanote Line to Shinjuku City, where our hotel is. 
            The train ride takes about an hour. We will be able to check in to our hotel at approximately 5pm.
            At 6pm, we are exploring Shinjuku City. Since we are staying in the center of the city, all the activities are right outside of our door.
            </p></div>
            <p>Here is the Train Map</p>
